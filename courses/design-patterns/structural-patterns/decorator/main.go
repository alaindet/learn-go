/*
Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator pattern allows to add behavior to any component by wrapping it
without altering it

It is more flexible than simple inheritance since you can have any number of
decorators on a component. They are more generic hence reusable

- It gives new functionality without altering the base component (open-closed principle)
- It encapsulates a new feature (single responsibility principle)
- It embeds the already existing features of the decorated component
