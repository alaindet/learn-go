# Test Coverage

"Test coverage is a term that describes how much of a package’s code is exercised by running the package’s tests. If executing the test suite causes 80% of the package’s source statements to be run, we say that the test coverage is 80%." [from https://go.dev/blog/cover]

## Usage

`go test -cover`
